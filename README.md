# Authentication API with Java 23 and Spring Boot
This project is an authentication API built with Java 23 and Spring Boot. Originally intended as a forum, it evolved into a reusable authentication solution, particularly useful in a microservices architecture.

The main goal is to explore and implement Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles while providing a solid foundation for user management and authentication across multiple projects.
